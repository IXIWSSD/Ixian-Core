    ///  This mechanism is used by clients, who do not wish to disclose all their addresses ahead of time, to 'register' to an untrusted DLT Node
    ///  in order to receive information (events) when the client's addresses are encountered on the blockchain. It would be unfeasible for the DLT
    ///  Node to send all events to all clients (bandwidth prohibitative), so some filtering is required. By using this object, the client sends the
    ///  DLT Node a 'condensed' piece of information which matches multiple addresses, *including* the ones the client is interested in. There are false
    ///  positives, but never false negatives.
    ///  Of course, the DLT Node may record which addresses match the 'matcher', but it is impossible to determine which of the matches are false positives and
    ///  which are real.
    ///  Whether a given address truly belongs to a client can only be determined with 100% accuracy when the client chooses to use it - send a transaction from
    ///  that address, thus revealing the public key and nonce associated with it.
